# Topological Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a "generalization" of the well-known game tic-tac-toe that is playable in terminal. 
Besides being able to modify the size of the table, you can set it's topology. Possibly the
most well-known example is a torus of which we can think about as the world of Pac-Man. In 
TTTT a torus shaped table would be represented as a table with rows and coloumns indexed on
both sides, top and bottom:the numbering on the left and on the top denote the index of the
corresponding row and coloumn respecively, while the numbering on the right and on the col-
oumn denotes which row/coloumn the corresponding row/coloumn is identified with. For instan-
ce walking far east on the table would result in ending up far west in the same coloumn.
